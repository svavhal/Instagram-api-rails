Get Instagram public posts using Instagram api and parse the JSON data using REST-CLIENT and I will save them into my local database
and create tags

I am passing a hash to Instagram.tag_recent_media in which ruby on rails developer can see :count=> 100 which will return 100 posts for a particular tag. By default instagram will return 20 posts for a tag.

add a tag to get posts. Developers will be able to get posts in posts model

Now, if you visit http://localhost:3000/posts/index you will have data of all your posts. Instagram returns an array of hashes in which every hash refers to a post. Every post contains data.
